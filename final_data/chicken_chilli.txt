Chilli Chicken Ingredients
ingredients for chilli chicken Pin
For Fried Chicken
Chicken - Use boneless chicken breast chopped into small pieces. You can use boneless chicken thighs. Make sure you cut into small pieces. Chicken cooks faster when cut into small pieces also it coats well in the thick sauce when fried in small pieces.

All Purpose Flour - plain flour creates a binding for the chilli chicken. I like to use combination for flour and cornstarch to create the coating for chicken.

Cornstarch - cornflour or cornstarch creates helps for the crispiness. A combination of cornstarch and plain flour creates the crispy coating.

For Chilli Chicken Sauce
Sauces - Tomato Ketchup, Green Chilli Sauce, Vinegar and Soy Sauce is used in chilli chicken.

Onions - you can use chopped white part of the spring onions in the chilli chicken.

Ginger & Garlic - use chopped ginger and garlic for the flavourings of the chilli chicken.

Chillies - chillies is the main ingredient for making chilli chicken. it adds the spicy kick for the popular indo-chinese dish. Use dry red chillies and fresh green chillies for added spice. I like to add a dash of chilli powder.

Garnish - spring onions and coriander leaves is added for garnish.
