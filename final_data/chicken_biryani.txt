Biryani is a celebration of all that is great about Indian food â€“ the heady aromas, the vibrant colours, the fluffy rice and those addictive curry flavours. Make this Chicken Biryani with your protein of choice â€“ or try a vegetable biryani!

Biryani recipe
One of the most requested recipes is finally here! Another RecipeTin Family effort, it took us seven attempts to get this biryani right.

Seven attempts means seven heated arguments about who would take the leftover biryani because somebody in the RecipeTin family, at any point in time, usually declares themselves to be on a diet to address blog-related weight gain concerns.

And it was worth it. (Belly and all.) Biryani, we canâ€™t get enough of you!

WHAT IS BIRYANI, AND WHY DO I LOVE IT SO MUCH?
Essentially, itâ€™s your favourite chicken curry (or vegetable or other protein of choice) buried under a mound of delicately spiced fluffy rice, all made in one pot. The rice is steamed over a low heat so it absorbs the flavours of the curry bubbling away underneath.

So in a nutshell, itâ€™s every curry loving-carb monstersâ€™ dream come true. Itâ€™s got my name written all over it!

ABOUT THIS BIRYANI
Youâ€™ll find variations of Biryani all across the Indian subcontinent, from Pakistan to Bangladesh, Afghanistan to India. There are 2 main types â€“ one where the protein and/or vegetables are cooked mixed throughout the rice, and the other version known as Hyderabad-style biryani in India where meat and rice are layered and cook in a sealed pot over fire. The latter is the style of biryani Iâ€™m sharing today.

Thereâ€™s a wonderful Afghani restaurant in my area called Sahar (Newport, Sydney) which serves a Biryani thatâ€™s a huge favourite among locals. Hands down, the best ethnic restaurant I know in the upper northern beaches.

HOW TO MAKE BIRYANI
Chicken marinated in a spiced yoghurt is placed in a large pot, then layered with fried onions (cheeky easy sub below!), fresh coriander/cilantro, then par boiled lightly spiced rice.

The crowning glory is to finish it off with a drizzle of saffron infused water to give it the signature patches of bright yellow rice, as well as ghee (or melted butter) for buttery richness.

The pot is then covered and cooked over a low heat for about 25 minutes during which time the rice absorbs the aromas and flavours of the curry underneath, whilst still being beautifully fluffy.

Preparation steps for Biryani

That moment when you lift the lid and are greeted with this sightâ€¦

â€¦. that moment is only second to this: when you dig deep into the pot, ensuring you get some of every layer, and the full force of the aroma from the curry buried deep under the rice hits you, and it takes every single bit of will power to gravitate that spoon towards a bowl instead of attempting to shove that entire giant scoop in your mouthâ€¦.

OK wait. Did you almost lose control too?

Iâ€™m almost done. Bear with me â€“ just want to show you a few more things before handing over the recipe!

BIRYANI SPICES
Thereâ€™s subtle flavourings used for the rice, and a load more used for the curry sauce.

Thereâ€™s a lengthy list but thereâ€™s nothing exotic here, you can find all these spices at everyday supermarkets here in Australia. Some recipes call for Asafoetida which is an Indian spice that requires a trip to an Indian grocer. We tried it with and without, and I swear we could not taste a difference. So we donâ€™t use it. ðŸ™‚

CHEEKY SUB FOR FRIED ONION
Thin slices of onion fried until sweet and a bit crispy, this is used as one of the layers in the Biryani as well as a garnish for serving.

If you arenâ€™t a fan of deep frying or are a beginner cook, my cheeky alternative is using store bought fried onion (Asian or Indian stores) or Asian Fried Shallots (pictured below) which are sold at everyday supermarkets. They add the same oniony flavour with the added bonus of extra crunch!

THE ROOTS OF THIS RECIPE
Another recipe ticked off the Recipe Request list, another RecipeTin family effort!!

As always, we love to look to the pros to build a starting point for recipe inspiration. We ate biryani at our favourite specialty restaurants in Sydney, Pakistani chain Student Biryani in Auburn, and the Indian restaurant Paradise Biryani House in North Strathfield.

To learn the techniques, we looked at a few books (love the local library!), dozens of internet pages and Youtube videos from home cooks in India.

Yes the ingredients list is long â€“ but youâ€™ll find everything at the supermarket. And while there are a number of steps to make Biryani, it is actually quite a straightforward recipe. (Video is helpful too!)

And even if yours doesnâ€™t turn out perfect, donâ€™t be put off because even less than perfect biryani is still delicious (we happily scoffed the first few test batches despite the flaws!). â€“ Nagi x
